What if you didn't have to worry about managing user passwords as a Python developer? That's where the Web Authentic Protocol and new hardware standards are heading. This week on the show, Dan Moore from Fusionauth returns to discuss a password list future. WEBAUTH n is a way to authenticate users using biometric secure authentication methods. Dan dives into pass keys, ceremonies, authenticators, and hardware standards. We also cover several projects and libraries that could help you get started with Web authent in Python. This episode is brought to you by C Data Software, the easiest way to connect Python with data, SQL, access to more than 250 cloud applications and data sources. Alright, let's get started. Uh. The Real Python Podcast is a weekly conversation about using Python in the real world. My name is Christopher Bailey. Your host. Each week, we feature interviews with experts in the community and discussions about the topics, articles and courses found at uh, Real Python.com. After the podcast, join us and learn real world Python skills with a community of experts at Real Python.com. Hey Dan, welcome back to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. Yeah, so we were talking back in Episode 99, we're kind of diving into OAuth and sort of setting that up and maybe some potential Python solutions there. And you recently reached out to me after, I guess you had just written this article about Web OffN. Is that how it's pronounced? Yeah, I pronounced web OffN for sure. Good. Yeah, because there's lots of, uh, acronyms and stuff we'll be diving into today. And I know it's not the most deepest Python, this kind of like, subject, but I am fascinated by this technology and I want to know more about it. And I think anybody who develops stuff on the web, I really see this affecting them and hopefully getting us beyond a, uh, password sort of future here because I know that's been the dream for a while and so I'm very excited to talk about it. Yeah, definitely. I mean, like you said, the core of them is really built into browsers and JavaScript API. But anybody who builds web applications or websites where people log in should have this on the radar, because the long short of it makes it easy to leverage strong forms of authentication like biometrics or things that are built into your phone, fingerprint readers, et cetera, into a web application without you having to do the heavy integration lifting. So that's why I'm really excited about it. Yeah, I think that's really cool. And it attacks the problem from a slightly different angle and we're going to provide a lot of resources. And your article was really great. It was WEBAUTH and explained on your Fusionauth, uh, blog is it just Fusionauth Developer Expert Advice for developers sort of series there mhm. So we're going to have lots of little acronyms. We're going to kind of work through talk, um, about maybe some differences there. What I want to start with first is I had heard about, I think it's called the Fido Alliance, and then heard more about Web authent after that. Maybe you could describe the difference between those two to get some people up to speed as to what's happening there. Sure. Yeah. So the Fido Alliance started in the, uh, early two thousand and ten s, and I think PayPal was a member and some other folks, and Fido stands for Fast Identity Online. And so they were a group of companies that really realized that we needed to have better ways to authenticate quickly, mostly because they wanted users to have a better experience and a more secure experience. And they came out with a couple of standards. And one thing maybe familiar, some of your users or some of your sorry, no, you don't have users, you have listeners. Some of your listeners are, uh UBI keys. Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yup, yup. And so, in the mid 2010, the Fido folks got together with the folks at the W three C, I want to say 2016. 2017, and came up with like a second version of this password list system. And this one leverages some of the work they've previously done. And then also there's a portion of it that's built in the browser. So you can imagine there's like a pipeline between the end user, some kind of authentication device, right? Like a UB key or Face ID or Phone or something like that. And then the browser, and then a, uh, website. And so Web Authentic handles the interactions between the browser and the website. And then there's a second protocol called CTAP, which handles communication between the browser and the Authenticator is what it's called, which is the thing that actually does the actual authentication, that does, um, secrets management and some other things. That's kind of the secret sauce behind why Web Authentic is like passwordless and secure. Yeah. And it's worth noting that CCAP can be actually used by not just a browser, but it could be like a desktop, uh, application or something like that. Okay. We were talking about like, Apple TVs and stuff before, too. And some of these other third devices in the home could have used for something like that, too. I think those third devices are probably if they're actual real applications, then yes, if they're Web applications, then they're probably going to be using about then okay. Maybe we could describe what a UB key is. And the other question I have about that is, like, how many of them are probably even out there? Uh, was it a popular device for people to buy? There was a recent action that happened in the Python space, where the Python Packaging Authority took the top 1% of all packaging projects that are most downloaded and offered every one of those projects. Uh, one of the keys mhm, or if they chose not to, they could still use some other form of two factor multi factor authentication, but they wanted to make sure all those projects at least had that going. And so I was just intrigued by like, okay, well I think that was like maybe 1000 or something like that. But is it something that's huge in the corporate world? Yeah, so I don't have a great grasp on that. Right, okay. I definitely know UB keys are, uh, totally aimed. There are consumers who have UB keys, but I think they're mostly the system in folks who are kind of really serious about security. Anyway, what webauthen opens up is, and one of the reasons why webauthon is exciting is that all the browsers on all the operating systems support it. So there's things that integrated in with the operating system, like Android fingerprint, Face ID, Touch ID, Windows, hello, and those all leverage the same, are accessible via the same web author APIs. So a lot more hardware. Yeah, exactly. And if you're looking at like consumer logins, for consumers, asking someone to buy a UB key is kind of a lift, because I think if they're tens of dollars right. They're not super expensive, but they're yeah. I went to look on Amazon because I found like a link, and it was like maybe fifty dollars to sixty dollars, depending on, uh, the type of connector, like USBA or C or what have you. And I would definitely let my employer spend $60 on me. Right. But if you ask me to log into all my personal accounts, uh, it's going to be a big lift. But certainly I already have my phone, right. M, and many people do, or I already have my computer. So that's really where I think about then is kind of the surrounding ecosystem is a step above what Fido was doing in the early 2010, because you just have way more hardware available for people to use. Yeah, many, many generations now, I think it was iPhone five S or something like that, and started Touch ID, something like that. So that's a lot of generations ago. I looked up for a talk, I think it was 2013, it was first Touch ID was first made available. And a little bit of trivia for you all. Um, the first phone with the builtin fingerprint reader was actually the Motor, uh, Altrix in 2011. So it's been around, uh, here's a long time, in digital terms, for sure. Right. And then there's the whole Android INQUIS system, and almost all of those have some sort of either facial recognition or fingerprint. Uh, also a lot of phones out there, so I would imagine that would be probably the most common hardware kind of coming in. Yes. Is there something special that you need to download or set up on your phone to do this, or is it something that when you go to a particular website, it will through the authentication system, like trigger sort of a lookup on your phone. How's that work? So there's a couple of things. First is you obviously need to enable fingerprint recognition or whatever on your phone or your device. If that's not enabled, then WebAssign is not going to magically be able to enable it for you, but concern it on. WebAssign works with kind of public private keys. And the private keys are held on the device, the phone or the UB key or whatnot. And then the public keys are what the website gets. And there's some more attendance both there. But at the end of the day, that's really the fundamental exchange. And so WEBAUTH has these things called ceremonies, called flows as well. And you need to as a user, be able to basically get that public key up to the website and associate with your account somehow. And there's a couple of different ways to do that. One common way is you have someone log in with a normal uh, username and password or SSO using Google or something like that. And then they can associate uh, public key with their account and then they can use that. Web authentic workflow or the past key workflow is another way that I've heard it put for all future authentications if they want. Okay, so it's like a sort of a set up initial process. Create your username. Yes, it's called registration flow. Okay? And then when you said SSO, a single sign on, we'll talk about the risks of some of these uh, existing sort of standards as we go. But that would be like sign on with Google or GitHub or some other thing where, if you will, a third party that has, I don't know, maybe a larger set of uh, accounts in your life that kind of makes sense. Well, I'll just have a single sign on for all those. And that was like one of the solutions that's been out there for a while for trying to remember lots of passwords. Yes, you basically delegate that because I don't know about you Christopher, but I pay a lot more attention to my Gmail account than I do to J random sites. I have MFA enabled for it. That's the premise behind single sign or social sign on. But um, yeah, so there are ways you can set up Web authent so that you don't have to have that initial account creation. They're just a little more limited in terms of the way the hardware works. And my experience is definitely more focused on the reauthentication flow right now because at the end of the day, it really is about reducing user, um, friction. And uh, authentication is a big friction point in my life. See Data software connect, integrate, and automate your data from Python or any other application or tool. At C Data, they simplify connectivity between all of the applications and data sources that power business, making it easier to unlock the value of data. Their SQL based connectors streamline data access, making it easy to access realtime data from onpremise or cloud databases. SAS APIs. No sequel and big data. Check out C data.com. That's Cdata.com to learn more. Maybe we could dive into that a little bit further. Like, the idea of a public key and a private key is kind, uh, of a similar behavior that if anyone has explored, like https and sort of that workflow in, um, fact, in your article use the same kind of people in there. The Alice and Bob example, which I think is sort of like a textbook example of people. But, um, now we're kind of doing it with this sort of other form of authentication. But the idea of you sending this public key out and then only you are able to create something that is privately signed and it's, I guess, very hard to tamper with because it won't look like you anymore. And so that whole, like you mentioned it as a I've heard it called a challenge. You called it what was the term that you use, where it's sort of prompting the person for the private key signature? I don't recall what I said, I'm sorry. It's just saying, well, you have to sort of prove that you as the user name that please sign this challenge with your private key. And here's the yeah, maybe the piece of hardware I was talking about is called an authenticator. Yeah. Okay. Um so that's kind of a generic term for anything that holds the private keys and can verify who the user is, right. There's sort of a ceremony of it or whatever. Yeah. Okay. What I thought of is a bit of an analogy. I don't know if it works perfectly, but you've given out your username this sort of public key. And I was kind of thinking about, okay, maybe you've uh, given some sort of tool that can read invisible inc, but you have a personal recipe for creating invisible ink and signing something in it and only you can write it in that way, and it can only be viewed with that particular, you know, that public view. Uh, it would not show up the same. It would be easy to kind of tell that somebody sort of tampered with it or tried to create it in a different way. It's like having your own unique way of looking at it. I don't know if it works out. Well, but no, it's almost like, yeah, you're right. I've given the entire world a flashlight that can read my invisible link only. Yeah. Right. And so I can write in that invisible link. And if someone else tries to write with a different kind visible link, that flashlight won't show them. It won't show anybody who holds it the message. That should be easy to tell it's been tampered with. Yeah, what I was wondering about, one of the things I thought was kind of interesting is that you have a chart mentioning sort of the browser support and kind of where things are. And I uh, was looking at the list of all the different authentication APIs stuff and I was wondering, do you think Internet Explorer was holding this back in some case? Well, and that chart credit workers do that from Ken Iuse.com, which is just an amazing website if you want to know about specifics if M, you just search for Ken I use Web Author and I think they're like the number one results. I think that Ie just probably the Microsoft team just decided that they were all in on edge and it wasn't worth doing that update. So that's my guess. I don't have any insight information. Yeah, so one of the things that this helps with and why it should be interesting to a uh, developer, um, is the idea that you are really no longer holding on to passwords and the whole ritual of potentially you get a password and then, okay, am I going to save this password in my system? Hence why people prefer in some ways to maybe use single sign on, on their site. Okay, well the third party can authenticate and I uh, don't have to collect all that information, but also just the whole process of making sure that you're properly hashing or salting. And even then that information can get attacked or taken from the site and we hear about those sort of breaches all the time. And in this case, there's really not any kind of secret that's saved that, right? Yeah. There's the public key, which by definition is something that no one cares if right. That's a user will. Right, yeah. I mean you could think of it uh, as a username because there might be some metadata attached to it as well. But yes, it is nothing that will actually help you complete a Web Authentic workflow or is useful in any other way. So without any server side secrets there, uh, it kind of makes it really not an attack vector that would be interesting anymore. Yeah. And the Web Authentic folks actually have introduced some other things too, because they came out later. It doesn't work at all. Over Http, you just can't use web and over Http, it just won't work. Um, and every kind of that registration ceremony that we talked about that happens for the website to get the uh, credential or the public key that is bound to a domain name. And if you make a request, but you kind of pass in a different domain name from where you're serving from. What I'm saying, again, says, hey, no dice. So there's like this more strong kind of tying to the domain name system, which makes it harder for attackers to try to get access to those credentials or uh, even that signed payload that proves someone is who they are without somehow getting into your website. So that like a phishing attack would be less like it would be much harder to do or maybe not even possible. Yeah, I mean it depends on how your website is configured and how you ask for things. Because you can ask for not just a specific example.com domain, but you could ask for let anybody underneath example.com do the well done. But yeah, if you are checking correctly, it becomes harder. And the other point about fishing, I'm glad you brought that up, is that lots of times and we saw this with uh, I think the Octa attack and some other attacks that happened recently, people get fished for their second factor of authentication. Someone uh, says they get a text message or maybe 100 text messages, or 100 push notifications. And eventually they say yes. Or someone calls and says, hey, what's that code? You can do that with code based MFA, but with what about then you can't actually hand over the uh, signature. Right. It bounds that device. So it helps the fishing in both ways. Yeah. I don't really use it much, but I have an Instagram account that I created and it's a single word, it's a dictionary word and I don't use it. And it's got like three posts or something on it. And I constantly get the emails of somebody saying it seems like you're having trouble getting into your account. And uh, I never did the part of set up an SMS type of thing, which I'm kind of glad because it'd probably be gone by now at this point. Like if somebody would have probably taken it because that seems easier to hack in my as an opinion. Especially for somebody who's like trying to get that elite single word login or something like that for Instagram or something like that. But it baffles me. But um, there's like all those kinds of things where you can sort of spoof SMS or they call them your sims or whatever. Right. So I have two questions there. The first is, is the single word python? I have to ask that question. No. And the second is more of a comment. I think SMS is uh, definitely spoofing. The attacks I've heard of often depend on them knowing your phone number and then calling up the mobile phone operator and the customer service people switching things around. I heard of several attacks like that. I hope I'm never on the side of that type of thing. But yeah, it's pretty wild to think about. And I've definitely moved to the other types of multi factor type of authentication systems like uh, Google Authenticator or Aughty, I think. Yeah, it's a challenge to get a new phone. Yeah. Got to move everything over. How would this deal with that? What happens if you get new hardware? Yeah, the thing about Web Authentic is unless you're using something so there are some kind of vendor specific ways around this, but for the straight up standard, you have to register each new device. So what you would do is you go through the same registration process and then depending on how the website is implementing things, they may offer you, like a choice. Hey, I see you have three Web Authentic accounts or public keys associated with your account. Which one do you want to log in with? Okay. Yeah. So, like, I know in the Apple world, they are trying to do it through icloud, and they have their term I think is a passkey that they're kind of using. So if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and I'm sorry, I used to work for Apple, I'm a bit of an Apple nerd, so I have a lot of their stuff. Um, plus I bought a lot of music equipment and stuff that only works on it. Fair. And I actually was kind of checking out like, I have one of the developer accounts and they had a WDC talk on it. Um, that was in 2021, and I won't share the link because you can't log into it, but it's basically the title of it was moved beyond passwords. It was pretty good explanation. Kind of diving into this a little bit more. I think it might be a good one if you go through your article and kind of catch up with some of the stuff is happening and then you kind of see, like, how a hardware provider is kind of looking at how to do this and set up their developers for it, and they show a little bit of code at the end. Yeah, I think, uh, there is like Oil then is still under develop or not under development. It's been released, I think it was released in 2019, finalized. But now they're working on the next version okay. Which I think will try to solve that problem. So they're working with Apple and Google who have these solutions that, frankly, private keys should never leave devices. That's one of the premises of web opinion. Uh, but then the cost is you have to register all these new devices. If you lose a device and you don't have any other device registered for that account, you're hosed. I think it's the technical term, right? It's like dropping your pubic key somewhere or something. Totally. So I think they're working on like secure storage in the cloud of that private key, which obviously they can encrypt and ship over to do some other things with. But I, um, do know that there are proprietary solutions right now, and I think that the Web US and Working Group is working on ways to standardize that and try to solve that user interface issue. So maybe we could talk about where, uh, places that you're seeing this being used. Like what are sites or places that are actively using it. Is this something that you can choose? Like, if you already have a UB key or whatever, that you could have selected a particular site to do this on. I guess I haven't started to use it yet, and so I'm like, okay, where does this look different for me if I've decided to move into it as a user and then we can talk about as a developer, maybe after that. Sure. Yeah. I definitely know that it's used. The only consumer facing site that I've seen on is Best Buy, which makes sense, kind of knowing their target market. I definitely have read about people using it as another factor of authentication for their GitHub account or your ad. Okay. I think it's that point where if Best Buy is implementing it, I think there's some momentum behind it. I think there's going to be more and more sites out there building this. In the big one, I think it. Was Amazon just, um, like the marketplace of it. Right. Yeah. That makes me think about something too, then, is like m my wife is the one who has an account for Amazon. Um, she's the prime. It's like family here. Um, I have to sort of log in as her, and then it prompts her phone to prompt for a code or whatever. I wonder how that would be handled with families. Is that something they would have to think about with multiple hardware then? Uh, as far as an account that's somewhat like that, that might be shared. I mean, the way I approach it is the same as like, if I want to have web authentic work with my Mac and my Android device, I register both devices go in the sort. Of setup process that we were talking about before. There'd be like additional things that you're registering as. Yep. So you have your phone and she'd have her phone. And if I were Amazon and I was doing this, I would definitely anyone who only had one device, I would send emails and more. Because you just don't want to have someone drop their phone. Yeah. It's literally like getting all credit cards for sure. Okay. All right. So it's sort of rolling out. Uh, and I guess it's sort of a chicken and egg. You need the hardware all set up and ready to go and be part of the operating systems and stuff like that. And at the same time, then the websites need to figure out how they're going to implement it and start setting that up, I guess. Yeah. And actually, I just thought of another I think Intuit was using it as well. So there's a couple of okay. That would be really handy. Yeah. I think it's not a chicken egg problem because to use your analogy, the chicken is already taken care of. Right. For whatever reason. Probably, uh, because they want to make our lives more secure. Right. All the browser vendors and all the OS vendors have built this in. So now it's a really question of your audience. The web developers stepping up and actually implementing this on the web applications so that users can get the benefits of it. And I won't speak too much about the benefits of it from user perspective, but I know the first time I did it, it really does seem like magic. Because uh, you basically click on a button saying hey, this is my username, essentially. And then you get a prompt that comes up and you hold your fingerprint over it and boom, you're logged in. Nice. And for someone who's used to just I have a password manager. Continually copy paste my password manager. It was just amazingly frictionless. Yeah, I'm not proud of the fact that I have two password managers, but uh, I got a new laptop this year and so I kind of started to go all in on the touch ID. I don't know, it's called icloud keychain, what have you. Um, and so maybe it's a similar flow where prompts me use your fingerprint now to basically um, prompt me to put in a password and username and password. And that actually works pretty well. Is that for web applications or is that for like internal stuff like your IDE or just logging on to your Mac? Well, it's to log on to my Mac and wake it up from sleep. But then also, uh, since it stores all my passwords in that icloud Chief chain, or a large percentage of them, I should say, um, it's the same thing. Like I'm logging into a credit card or I'm logging into uh, other services and things like that. It actually works pretty well. But I also have one password and that's partly a work thing and honestly, it's kind of clunky and I end up copying and pasting out of it because like the way it would prompt it would fight with the other one. And so it's kind of like having to go back and forth between the browsers and things like that. And I know a lot of people probably do the same thing. You're in a browser and you have it, maybe remember passwords inside the browser? M. Um, like maybe you do certain things in Firefox or um, Brave or some other kind of browser and you say, well, this thing could save some of the passwords too, but that's still not completely secure. In some ways the passwords are there. Uh, I don't know if there have been some hacks of password manager services like LastPass and things like that. I don't know of all of them. But I thought I heard about that. I mean, I don't want to spend FUD, but certainly like uh, if I were an attacker, a centralized repository of users'passwords and usernames would be very attractive to me. And get back to your point earlier, right? Web then is decentralized. And so if the Last password somehow holding all these public keys, no one cares. This week, I want to shine a spotlight on. Another real Python video course. It's another of this new type of video course we're having on Real Python. Instead of being based on one of our written tutorials, it's a conversation about code. For this conversation, it's about how to prepare your code so it's ready to share when looking for help or support from other programmers or a community. The course is titled Refactoring. Prepare Your Code to get help. And the instructors for this code conversation are, uh, Real Python authors Philip Axteni and previous guest Martin Royce. They'll take you through how to write clear concise questions using how or why, removing obstacles and visual clutter from your code, renaming variables and functions for clarity, exploring several techniques to improve your code by refactoring, and how to raise and catch exceptions within nested functions. Throughout this code conversation, you'll get insight from two Real Python team members. Whether you're looking for help from within the Real Python community or the larger Python community, I think this course will help you prepare your code for these conversations. Real Python video courses are broken into easily consumable sections and where needed, include code examples for the techniques shown. All lessons have a transcript, including closed captions. Check out the video course. You can find a link in the show notes, or you can find it using the enhanced search tool on Realpathon.com. Can we talk about the Python pieces? Yes, let's move it to let's talk to the developer side, because I think that's really the next step is like, OK, well, how do we set this up? And I think there probably are some different choices and being a kind of a new platform or new technology for developers, i, uh, was wondering what, uh, level these things are at, and so I guess we'll kind of discuss them. So what do you got? Yes, so again, if you want to think about the whole registration ceremony or authentication ceremony, right, there's kind of two distinct pieces there's generating the options that you need for the particular authenticator to be recognized. And that's done via, uh, just creating some options in JavaScript. And so I found a couple of at least one library that does that for you. In Python. You basically build out what you want in Python in terms of, uh, there aren't too many options, but one is, do you want to support only authenticators that have built in that are built into like a computer or a phone, and those are called platform Authenticators? Or do you want to support cross platform Authenticators, where cross platform means it's like a UBT that you move between different computing devices. And so that is taken care of by, uh, something called Pi underscore WEBAUTH end. But there's the other piece of all that credential management, like prompting the user and then saving off the public key and then knowing how to attach it to the user. And I found a framework for that that, um, one worked with Flask and it was called Piwarp. And there was another one that I think works with Flask and Chalice, I want to say, and that was called Will at NRP. And again, for all your listeners, will have all these in the links. Yeah, I did look into Django because I know that's kind of one of the big web frameworks with Python. Yeah, we talk about it often. Yeah, there were a couple of alpha level projects and they basically were very clear that they said, hey, we're alpha level, so they're probably looking for help. But uh, one's called Django WEBAUTH and the other is called Django Web Authentic with an in. Both those didn't seem like they were probably ready for prime time. Okay. So there's some movement there, and so people can kind of look at them. The trick here is, do you think that someone would probably be having to set up multiple choices for authentication at the moment? I don't understand the question, I'm sorry. It's okay. Do you think that if you were going to create a Flask website and you were interested in setting up Web author, do you think that at the current time that you might have to probably have additional choices also? Yes, I think you would. And I think that there's two main reasons for that. The first is that registration flow that we talked about is much easier to conceptualize and much more widely supported if you have existing uh, account to hang that public key off of. Okay. And the second is the reset problem, right? Like, what happens if I register with webauthen and I only have one device on there and then I, ah, lose it? Well, if I have, um, I can always call customer service and kind of try to convince them that I have access to that account, or I should have access to account. But we live in an automated world, and so if you can associate an email address with it, or um, some other path or phone number, then you can build in those self service reset. Flows, which, yeah, it's pretty common, our. Attack sector, but also are such a convenience, right? Yeah. That's always going to be a thing, right. You're going to need to have a way to recover if something goes odd, because how much of your life is online. I did want to mention one other kind, uh, of Python tool, which, if you remember, there's the Web Authentic side, which is kind of, um, website to, uh, browser. And then there's the CTAP two side, which is browser to, uh, authenticate. And they're all kind of called together, called Fido. There's actually a tool called Python 502 by the ubiquitous folks that lets you kind of manipulate and access Fido stuff from the command line. So if, um, you need to generate some challenge, or you integrate with something that's not a website, you may want to look at that tool, that library. Yeah. So if you're in that world with the hardware keys yeah. Cool. No, it should conceivably again, I haven't played with this directly, but because it supports the 500 standard, it should actually be able to work with Touch, ID or any of those other things. Okay. It's not just a UB key specific tool. Ah, I don't believe oh, nice. I guess another potential way that someone could look at this is maybe through an authentication service. I know you were producing off, and we can throw the name out there again, but is that something that in the world of services, uh, that do this? Is that something that you guys have started to implement and some of your competitors and other people out there in the process of getting set up for? Yes. Uh, we are about to release Web Authentic Support. Okay. And so it'll be as simple as clicking a Toggle if you have an existing fusion. Uh, incident, um, I will notice part of our paid license plan, and then I know there are some other competitors out there. Keycloak has a Web Offend implementation m of the others that are kind of prominent orie does, Stitch does. So there are a couple of competitors out there that are odd does, although my understanding is odd. Zeros is kind of hidden behind a talk to sales, uh, type of process. But, um, I think that you absolutely could implement this yourself. And hopefully some of the links, some of the libraries that will be in this podcast, note will do that. But you absolutely could also rely on server, too. Yeah, I was just thinking just like, kind of a state of affairs kind of thing. Like, the more this is out there, the more public awareness of it is and more sites that are using it, and hopefully we can all move toward this passwordless future. Yeah. I would also say it's not just the passwords of the future that excites me. It's the standards based password future. Because there's actually been password list solutions out there that have been proprietary for a while longer, but this one has just mass adoption. And I think you're right that, um, the hope is that a lot more websites are going to start to offer this again. Maybe not the only way to log in, but a safe, secure way to let people reauthenticate or add an additional factor of authentication to just increase the ease and the user security for everyone. Yeah. So, Dan, I have these weekly questions, um, I'd like to ask you, and I know that you're not a regular Python developer at all times, but what is something that you're excited about in the world of Python that you've been hearing about? Yeah, so there's two things, actually, when I was looking around. The first is that Python two, uh, thousand and 23, the US. Was just opened their CFP, so I speak a lot at different conferences and stuff. And I'm definitely excited about the possibility of submitting to Python yeah. Back at Salt Lake City again this year. Well, and I would encourage anybody to like, if you've thought about public speaking how do I put this slightly, um, you will never learn something so well as when you're preparing to give a talk on it. So if you have something like, oh, man. Yeah. Especially in person right. I'd love to learn more about Web authent. You should pitch a talk to Python 2023 about Web Authentic. Because I guarantee you, if you get accepted, you will suddenly become one of the smartest people in the room about Web authend because you'll put in that work. And the other thing is, obviously, I love to see programming languages evolve, and I noticed that 311 was released. So congratulations to Python, folks, for continuing push.org. Yeah, it's pretty exciting. There's lots of fun changes and lot, uh, of activity, a lot of development happening. It almost feels too fast sometimes. Yearly release cadence, it's kind of made it a little bit quicker. What's going on? What's something that you want to learn next? Again, this doesn't have to be programming or even Python specific. Sure. Um, I mean, one thing I want to learn is even in the short time we've kind of been building out the Web author and stuff, I've seen a lot of interesting edge cases, and so I'm really looking forward to getting that release in the wild and being able to continually refine that because standards of standards. But there's always edge cases and then I'm not sure if there's any funds. You know what and I know this is pretty, um, how do I put this, uh, trendy, uh, of me. But I really have enjoyed pickling some things, and, um, my wife got me a book about pickling things, and so I'm going to be doing more of that. Just kind of preserving food. I've dabbled more in the, uh, as we call it, quickly. It's just like kind of quick pickling different things. Yeah. Like, I make kind, uh, of red onions to be, uh, for making fish tacos at home. Um, it's like lime juice and maybe like, a little bit of red vinegar. And then just mostly just thinly cut in some salt and just put it in a mason jar, shake it up and oh, my God, they're so good. Awesome. Yeah. What kind of things do you pickle? I've, um, done sauerkraut. I've done stuff. Kimchi. I actually really love Kimchi. M. Yeah. And then I tried to pickle turnips the other day, and I'll let you know how that works. Um, okay, we can have the sauerkraut. Let's just leave it at that. But, uh, it's kind of working at it right now. Nice. Yeah. Maybe you can share the book name and we'll put it in the show notes, too. Yeah, I definitely will. Well, Dan, thanks so much for coming on the show again. It's really fun to talk to you again. And thanks for sharing all this information about Web Offend. Yeah, well, thank you for having me. And if I could leave your listeners with one piece of advice is go sign up for Best Buys Web authent account and just see how easy and fun it is and think about your users having that same experience on your website.

And this one leverages some of the work they've previously done. And then also there's a portion of it that's built in the browser. So you can imagine there's like a pipeline between the end user, some kind of authentication device, right? Like a UB key or Face ID or Phone or something like that.

One common way is you have someone log in with a normal uh, username and password or SSO using Google or something like that.

And the other point about fishing, I'm glad you brought that up, is that lots of times and we saw this with uh, I think the Octa attack and some other attacks that happened recently, people get fished for their second factor of authentication.
